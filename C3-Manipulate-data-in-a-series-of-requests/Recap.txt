Recap:

we looked at how to use async/await to handle parallel and serial HTTP requests. 
We looked at how  Promise.all , along with destructuring syntax, 
is a powerful tool for leveraging multiple simultaneous AJAX requests.

What we did not do correctly, however, is error handling. 
We have a reject() call in our promise, but no way of handling any errors returned by the server. 
There are also other potential bugs because we have not really thought about what could go wrong.
