Recap:

handling text input with the  value  property

controlling what happens when a form is submitted with  preventDefault()

capturing input from multiple choice inputs with the  change  event

*******************

Other useful input events
Form inputs can emit some very interesting and useful events.  
here are a few other event examples:

input  — similar to the  change  event, the  input  event is emitted every time the user changes the input in a text field, 
and the  $event.target.value  property contains the current content of the text field

focus  /  blur  — when a user clicks or tabs to a form control and it becomes the active control, 
its  focus  event is emitted; when a user clicks or tabs away from a form control and it is no longer the active control, 
its  blur  event is emitted.
