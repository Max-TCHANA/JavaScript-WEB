HTTP
HTTP is a protocol which allows us to send information around the web. 
HTTP requests come in different flavors, using different verbs (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE are the four most common).  
A GET request generally means we would like the server to send us some data.

AJAX
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
Basically, it is a system that allows us to send requests and handle the responses from within our JavaScript code.  
For example, when you leave a comment on a blog post, when you send or receive e-mail on a webmail service like Gmail, 
or when a webpage updates itself without refreshing, it is often using AJAX to do so. 

API
API stands for Application Programming Interface. 
Many companies and services provide APIs which will react in specific ways when we send them HTTP requests. 


JSON
JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a way of representing and handling data as a JavaScript object. 
It is extremely useful for sending and receiving data over the internet, as it makes it easy to deal with structured data.
