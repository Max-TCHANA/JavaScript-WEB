Recap

In this chapter, we covered how to prepare, build, and send an HTTP GET request with AJAX, using an  XMLHttpRequest object.

Saving data in the browser
Modern browsers allow us to temporarily store small amounts of data for later use.  
There are two main methods: local storage and session storage.  
Session storage is emptied when the browser window is closed, whereas local storage remains untouched.  
While we don't need it for the app we have built here, it can come in handy in more complex apps.

For more information about web storage, check out the W3Schools article on the subject.
