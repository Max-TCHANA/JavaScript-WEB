Recap:

Use the following methods for accessing the DOM:

getElementsByTagName()

getElementsByClassName()

getElementById()

querySelector and querySelectorAll()

The DOM — one big family
As we discussed in the previous chapter, the DOM has a tree structure.  
In fact, it is a family tree structure, defining the relationships between elements. 
There are DOM methods and properties which allow us to use these family relationships to navigate and select elements.  
Here are a few:

element.children  — an  HTMLCollection  containing all child elements of element

element.parentElement  — element's parent element (any given element can only have up to one parent)

element.nextElementSibling  +  element.previousElementSibling  — these allow us to iterate through a given level (between list items, for example)
