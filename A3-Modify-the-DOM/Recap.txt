Recap:

modifying an element's contents with  innerHTML  and  textContent

adding and removing CSS classes with  classList

modifying styles directly with the  style  property

setting attributes with  setAttribute()

creating new elements with  createElement()  and adding them to the DOM with  appendChild()


Replacing and removing elements
DOM elements also have methods allowing their replacement and/or removal:  replaceChild()  and  removeChild() .  
Both methods call on the parent of the element you wish to remove, but you can cheat a bit and use  
myElement.parentElement.removeChild(myElement)  for example.

For more information about any of the methods described here, both the MDN and W3Schools have great reference material!
