Recap:
we covered the following techniques for user input validation:

during input with the input event,

after input is complete with the blur event,

HTML constraints such as required or pattern.

Of course, you can mix and match as many of these as you need.  
You can also add validation to the submit listener, giving a form one last check before submitting it.  
Front-end validation can only go so far, and servers must do their own validation too, 
to make sure that the incoming data is not harmful in any way. 
Using JavaScript to validate forms before sending them is useful.
